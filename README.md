# LED-music
A simple Arduino project for making the LED light up to the music beat. 
Simply using the the arduino analog read port for indicating the voltage input from the 3.5mm jack.
 Then depending what indicated we set the desired light effect on the LEDs.

There are two projects:
-  The first one (main branch) is made with RGB LED strip which i ordered by accident, but ended up using it instead.
-  The second one (second branch) is made for 1 diode alone. The idea in the beginning was to use this code, but i had to change it.
